# PYCCLE changes

Listed beginning with the most recent release

## Next version

- Fixed a bug in the metadata (date) generation scripts, which
  erroneously prevented assignment of dates to texts.  This affected 42
  texts in the ECCO (~2%) and 1394 texts in the EEBO (~3%).
- Manually assign dates to 11 texts in the EEBO for which the automatic
  assignment script fails.  There are 94 undated texts remaining (0.2%).

## Prerelease version 1

Limited release to Penn affiliates for beta testing.
